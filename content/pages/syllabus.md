Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / 4 weeks, 2 hours/ session

Labs: 3 sessions / week, 2 hours / session

Purpose of Course
-----------------

This one-week Independent Activities Period (January) class will provide an introductory-level introduction to mammalian neuroanatomy. You will be taught through lectures (the introductory lecture focusing on structure, and the concluding lecture focusing on function), and through hands-on lab experience.

The course will consist of two lectures and three labs. The labs will include:  
sheep brain dissection  
human brain slice viewing  
neuroimaging anatomy

Students will be divided into groups and assigned to a lab section at the end of the first class.

Requirements
------------

*   Lab questions to guide the dissection
*   Class attendance
*   Quizzes

You will need not only to attend class and lab, but also to do a bit of homework.

We have provided you with a list of {{% resource_link 85554383-9cee-f385-25a9-1133452d6938 "useful web sites" %}}, and will also give you handouts to review. 

We expect that you will have visited these web sites and read through the handouts before showing up at your section.

The questions for the lab are designed to be answered during the dissection of the sheep brain.
